I play [Heroes of the Storm](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/) and I use
[Logitech G600 mouse](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse).
HOTS' executable directory always changes with each version released and
my Logitech software loses track of the newly created directory, which I
had to always set by hand.

This script identifies the current game executable directory and updates
it over in the Logitech software's config files.
